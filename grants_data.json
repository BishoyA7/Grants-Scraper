        "Description:": "The CDC National Asthma Control Program is announcing a new, FY24 non-research notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) designed to improve the health and quality of life for people living with asthma.  This NOFO builds upon the work of state, local and territorial public health departments and their strategic partners supported by CDC through funding opportunity announcement CDC-RFA-EH19-1902.Asthma is a complex, highly prevalent chronic disease. It is consistently one of the top five most costly health conditions. According to 2021 asthma prevalence estimates, almost 25 million Americans have asthma, including about 4.7 million children and 20.3 million adults. There were 986,453 emergency department visits for asthma in 2020, 94,560 hospitalizations in 2020, 13.8 million missed school days in 2013, and 14.2 million missed workdays in 2018. In 2013, the estimated cost to the U.S. economy was $81.9 billion in medical expenses, missed school and workdays, and deaths. Despite available drugs and approaches to treat and control asthma, in the United States on average 10 people die of asthma each day.There are significant disparities in asthma outcomes by race, ethnicity, and income level. In the U.S., the burden of asthma falls disproportionately on non-Hispanic African American, Hispanic, and American Indian and Alaska Native populations. Disparities persist in asthma prevalence and outcomes in the United States. Non-Hispanic African American people are nearly three times as likely to die from asthma than white individuals. People from Puerto Rico have higher asthma prevalence compared to other people in the United States.Given evidence that a multi-component approach to controlling asthma is more effective than individual strategies applied in isolation, this NOFO is based on a technical package known as EXHALE (https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/pdfs/exhale_technical_package-508.pdf).  EXHALE represents six evidence-based strategies selected for their potential of having the greatest collective impact on controlling asthma.  These strategies include: Education on asthma self-management, eXtinguishing smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke; Home visits for trigger reduction and asthma self-management education (AS-ME); Achievement of guidelines-based medical management; Linkages and coordination of care; and Environmental policies or best practices to reduce indoor and outdoor asthma triggers.      This NOFO aims to address the systems-level, environmental, and social drivers of disparities by leveraging and expanding strategic partnerships to implement EXHALE strategies.  Recipients will strengthen existing organizational infrastructure (i.e., leadership and program management, strategic partnerships, surveillance, communication, and evaluation) and leverage existing partnerships with different sectors (e.g., community- and faith-based organizations, racial and ethnic minority-serving organizations, tribal communities, school and transportation systems, housing and healthcare systems, nongovernmental organizations) and community members to expand the reach and sustainability of asthma control services through implementation of EXHALE.",

        "Description:": "Developmental Sciences supports basic research that increases our understanding of perceptual, cognitive, linguistic, social, cultural, and biological processes related to human development across the lifespan. Research supported by this program will add to our knowledge of the underlying developmental processes that support social, cognitive, and behavioral functioning, thereby illuminating ways for individuals to live productive lives as members of society.\n\n\nThe Developmental Sciences program supports research that addresses developmental processes within the domains of perceptual, cognitive, social, emotional, language, and motor development across the lifespan by working with any appropriate populations for the topics of interest including infants, children, adolescents, adults (including aging populations), and non-human animals. The program also supports research investigating factors that affect developmental change, including family, peers, school, community, culture, media, physical, genetic, and epigenetic influences. The program funds research that incorporates multidisciplinary, multi-method, and/or longitudinal approaches; develops new methods, models, and theories for studying development; and integrates different processes (e.g., memory, emotion, perception, cognition), levels of analysis (e.g., behavioral, social, neural) and time scales. The program funds basic research that advances our understanding of developmental processes and mechanisms; the program does not fund clinical trials and research focused primarily on health outcomes.\n\n\nThe budgets and durations of supported projects vary widely and are greatly influenced by the nature of the project. Investigators should focus on innovative, potentially transformative research plans and then develop a budget to support those activities, rather than starting with a budget number and working up to that value.\n\n\nWhile there are no specific rules about budget limitations, a typical project funded through the Developmental Sciences program is approximately three years in duration with a total cost budget, including both direct and indirect costs, between $100,000 and $200,000 per year. Interested proposers are urged to explore the NSF awards database for the Developmental Sciences program to review examples of awards that have been made. Proposals that contain budgets significantly beyond this range may be returned without review.\n\n\nThe Developmental Sciences program also considers proposals for workshops and small conferences on a case-by-case basis. These typically have total cost budgets, including direct and indirect costs, of approximately $35,000. Conference proposals may only be submitted following an invitation from the Program Directors.\n\n\nIn addition to consulting the NSF awards database, it is often useful for interested proposers to submit (via email) a summary of no more than one page so that a program director can advise the investigator on the fit of the project for DS before the preparation of a full proposal. New investigators are encouraged to solicit assistance in the preparation of their project proposals via consultation with senior researchers in their area, pre-submission review by colleagues, and attendance at symposia and events at professional conferences geared towards educating investigators seeking federal funding.\n\n\nThe Developmental Sciences Program is always interested in identifying new reviewers. Potential reviewers should have a Ph.D. in psychology or a related field and have a demonstrated area of expertise relevant to developmental science. Individuals interested in reviewing for the program should complete an expression of interest form.\n\n\nSBE/BCS welcomes the submission of proposals to this funding opportunity that include the participation of the full spectrum of diverse talent in STEM,e.g., as PI, co-PI, senior personnel, postdoctoral scholars, graduate or undergraduate students, or trainees. This includes historically under-represented or underserved populations, diverse institutions including Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and two-year colleges, as well as major research institutions. Proposals from EPSCoR jurisdictions are especially encouraged.",

The program provides a platform for exchanging ideas, information, and best practices through virtual and in-person interactions. \n \nThe program seeks to bring U.S. experts and professionals to Kosovo to engage and share their American practices and perspectives with local audiences on a broad range of educational and cultural topics, thereby providing youth, emerging leaders, and established opinion makers with new and valuable insights they can apply to their lives and communities. \nPotential applicants are encouraged to focus on the following themes: \n·        Facilitating non-formal educational and cultural activities, including music and arts \n·        Providing skill building activities for youth from underserved communities\n·        Supporting trust-building and interethnic collaboration activities among Kosovan communities.\n*The term ‘Underserved Communities’ is defined in the Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Underserved Communities.\n\nTypes of Activities and Mode of Delivery:  \nThe U.S. Expert Program provides opportunities for U.S. experts to engage with Kosovan audiences through, but not limited to, formal and non-formal cultural and educational activities, lectures, workshops, conferences, seminars, media appearances, and consultancy services. However, this program does not encompass teaching university courses or conducting research programs.\nFor maximum impact, audience engagement is best achieved through a series of activities over an extended period; however, one-time events and short-term activities, such as conferences, may also be supported. The program accommodates both traveling and virtual experts and a blend of both, and applicants can request a single expert or a series of experts, subject to funding availability. Proposals should specify the preferred mode of engagement, whether traveling, virtual, or blended.\n·        Traveling Programs: A U.S.-based expert travels to Kosovo to deliver lectures, act as a consultant, jointly develop a program, or facilitate workshops and seminars, as deemed appropriate and arranged by the hosting organization. \n·        Virtual Programs: The U.S.-based expert engages with Kosovan audiences in real-time through virtual platforms. The expert may deliver the program remotely from within or outside the U.S. Virtual interactions can be tailored to be one-to-one, multi-point, or a combination, depending on the audience's nature and location. Please take into consideration the time difference when scheduling a virtual program.\n·        Blended Programs: The U.S.-based expert travels to Kosovo and also conducts a portion of the program virtually.\n\nTo access full call for proposal details click on \"Related Document\" \nIf you have any questions about the grant application process, please contact: pristinagrants@state.gov.\n",

Special Projects for Surveillance of Spina Bifida (optional)Component B applicants must submit an application for Component A. To be funded for Component B, the applicant must also be funded for Component A.",
        "Description:": "Synopsis: CDC-RFA-DD-24-0065 solicits non-research, cooperative agreement applications to conduct a project to identify a population-based sample of children and adults with spina bifida to estimate the prevalence and describe key outcomes with the goal of identifying opportunities to improve the health of individuals living with spina bifida. The population included in this surveillance activity can be an entire state or a region within a state. Individuals with spina bifida should be identified through existing data sources including the state birth defects surveillance program or vital records and long term health outcomes should be assessed using sources such as electronic health records, administrative data (e.g., Medicaid/Medicare, hospital discharge), or other sources available to funding recipients. This project will involve a required component (A) and an optional component (B). The total estimated funding for Component A is $8,000,000 for 5 years. The total estimated funding for Component B is $400,000 for 2 years (e.g., years 2 and 3 only) and will be subject to available funding.Background: Spina bifida is one of the most common types of structural birth defects with approximately 1,400 children born with spina bifida each year in the United States (U.S.). Current estimates for the U.S. include a greater number of adults living with spina bifida than children. Conducting population-based surveillance of children and adults with spina bifida is challenging. Birth defects surveillance systems identify babies born with a birth defect but do not follow them as children and adults. The National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR) provides valuable longitudinal information on the clinical care provided by spina bifida clinics but lacks information from other clinical settings and from the overall population of individuals with spina bifida. Standard survey methods, such as those that sample households, would not identify enough children and adults with spina bifida to produce reliable estimates and description of the population. Therefore, the objective of this surveillance project is to conduct population-based surveillance of children and adults with spina bifida by combining information from multiple sources (e.g., state birth defects surveillance systems, vital records, electronic health records, administrative data). Through this surveillance activity, it would be possible to assess their health status and healthcare use.Objectives: Component A objectives include: (1) estimate prevalence of spina bifida across all ages, along with mortality and survival; (2) describe healthcare utilization and sources of care; and (3) assess health status and long-term outcomes. The surveillance area can be an entire state or a region within in a state, with the applicant utilizing multiple data sources to generate an accurate and complete population-based sample. Required data sources include population-based birth defects surveillance systems (e.g., state birth defects surveillance), vital records, and sources for longitudinal follow-up (e.g., electronic health records, administrative data [e.g., Medicaid/Medicare; hospital discharge]). The objective of Component B will be to develop, implement, and evaluate a special project related to SB (e.g., novel approaches to case-finding, reporting, or outcome prediction).",

        "Description:": "Important! To successfully submit a proposal, you must visit the U.S. Embassy Accra's website for more information and a complete set of instructions. \nA. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\nThe U.S. Department of State’s Embassy Accra Public Diplomacy Section (PDS) announces an open competition for organizations to implement a project that strengthens Ghana’s democracy and promotes transparent, credible, and peaceful 2024 Presidential and Parliamentary elections that reflect the will of the people. Please carefully follow all instructions below. Full proposals may be submitted for consideration through March 24, 2024, 23:59. \nPriority will be given to projects that yield concrete, measurable results. Projects consisting solely of conferences or roundtable discussions, speaker series, theoretical research or surveys, or the writing or publishing of books, are unlikely to be funded.\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe United States and Ghana have a close and enduring friendship rooted in our mutual commitment to freedom and democratic values. Ghana is recognized as a stable, democratic country with a history of successful political transitions, a free press, an active civil society, and has held eight free and fair elections since 1992. Despite Ghana’s status as a relative model of democratic governance on the continent, governance systems at both the national and local level are weak, subject to corruption, and often insufficiently accountable to citizens. That is why the U.S. Government continues to work alongside our Ghanaian partners to improve accountable governance and strengthen democratic institutions in the country. \nAdditionally, under the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, of which Ghana is a partner country, our first objective is to: “strengthen social cohesion within and between at-risk communities; reduce community tensions and stigmatization between and among historically marginalized communities; and reduce instrumentalization of communal identities for political purposes.” Our second objective is to: “improve government responsiveness, inclusion, and accountability, to at-risk communities through strengthened inclusive, democratic political processes both locally and nationally; a strengthened environment for accountability and transparency; improved service delivery; and improved access to and trust in the justice sector.” \nProposals should encourage fair and inclusive political processes during the Ghana’s 2024 general election through activities that highlight shared values between the United States and Ghana. All programs must include a strong American element and/or connection with American expert(s), organization(s), or institution(s) (separate and beyond any involvement with the U.S. Embassy or its American Corners) that will promote increased understanding of U.S. policy and perspectives. \nPRIORITY PROGRAM AREAS \nPeace and Security: Activities that give voice to Ghanaian youth, marginalized communities, and local government through civic education and conflict resolution skills; strengthen citizenship and civic education so that communities will be able to engage in debate and sensitive conversations, and to hold one another accountable, without resorting to violence.\nMedia and Press Freedom: Activities that protect press freedom and strengthen the journalism profession through targeted training on fact checking, journalist ethics, and countering misinformation to journalists across the country; and promote media and information literacy, especially among youth so that Ghana’s media institutions and journalists are less vulnerable to external threats to their credibility, and more prepared to be valuable contributors to Ghana’s democratic process.  \nDemocracy and Civil Society: Activities that strengthen internal capacity for management, planning, and issue advocacy among civil society organizations, especially those reflecting marginalized voices underrepresented in the public debate or engaged in democracy and governance issues, in order to support more diverse opinions in civic engagement and public debate during the campaign season for the 2024 presidential elections, separate from the dominant political parties and their allies. \nPARTICIPANTS AND AUDIENCES\nPrograms may be geared to a variety of audiences, depending on the topic (institutions, civil society, media, community leaders, youth, etc.). Proposals will be evaluated based on a well-reasoned strategy for addressing the intended audience, stakeholders, and beneficiaries (primary and secondary). Proposals for projects that include participation of U.S. Government exchange alumni will be given additional consideration. \nB. FEDERAL AWARD INFORMATION\nAnticipated program start date: On or after June 1, 2024\nLength of performance period: 12 months or less\nNumber of awards anticipated: 2-5 awards (dependent on amounts)\nAward amounts: awards may range from a minimum of $15,000 to a maximum of $100,000\nTotal expected available funding: up to $150,000\nType of Funding:  19.040 – Public Diplomacy Programs;

(See 34 U.S.C. §§ 30107(a)(2) and 30108(a)(1)). Cybercrimes against individuals do not include the use of a computer to cause harm to a commercial entity, government agency or nonnatural person. Note: The term computer incudes a computer network and an interactive electronic device.",

        "Description:": "The ACED program seeks to harness computing to accelerate scientific discovery, while driving new computing advancements. The intent is to catalyze advancements on both sides of a virtuous cycle that: (a) benefit scientific disciplines through computational technologies and (b) foster novel computing technologies that will enable advances beyond the specific use cases or domains originally targeted. The program seeks continuous collaborations between at least two groups of researchers. One group is expected to consist of researchers in computing, which, for the purposes of this solicitation are those disciplines that are supported by the Core Programs of National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) directorate. The other group of researchers are expected to represent another scientific or engineering discipline, which, for the purposes of this solicitation, are defined as those supported within existing programs of the following NSF directorates: Biological Sciences, Engineering, or Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\nThe ACED program solicits proposals in two tracks:\n\nTrack I: Emerging Ideas Proposals:This track is intended to support speculative multidisciplinary projects that explore bold new research directions. The goal of these projects should be to obtain preliminary results, refine the overall research plan based on these results, and garner insights into whether these advances generalize beyond the targeted use case or domain. Projects are limited to $500,000 in total budget, with durations of up to 18-24 months. Proposals accepted in 2024 Deadline Date.\n\nTrack II: Discovery Proposals: The objective of this track is to support transformative interdisciplinary research that will significantly advance both computing and the scientific discipline(s) to be studied. Proposals should clearly identify the scientific problem(s) to be addressed; the specific computing techniques to be developed; and be supported by preliminary collaborations and/or results that demonstrate the potential of the proposed ideas. Projects are limited to $750,000 per year for a duration of up to 4 years for a total budget of up to $3,000,000. Proposals accepted in 2025-2026 Deadline Dates.",

        "Description:": "MCB supports research that promises to uncover the fundamental properties of living systems across atomic, molecular, subcellular, and cellular scales. The program gives high priority to projects that advance mechanistic understanding of the structure, function, and evolution of molecular, subcellular, and cellular systems, especially research that aims at quantitative and predictive knowledge of complex behavior and emergent properties. MCB encourages research exploring new concepts in molecular and cellular biology, while incorporating insights and approaches from other scientific disciplines, such as chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physics, to illuminate principles that govern life at the molecular and cellular level. MCB also encourages research that exploits experimental and theoretical approaches and utilizes a diverse spectrum of model and non-model animals, plants, and microbes across the tree of life. Proposals that pursue potentially transformative ideas are welcome, even if these entail higher risk.\n\n\nThis solicitation calls for proposals in research areas supported by the four MCB core clusters, including: (i) structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules and supramolecular assemblies, especially under physiological conditions (Molecular Biophysics); (ii) organization, processing, expression, regulation, and evolution of genetic and epigenetic information (Genetic Mechanisms); (iii) cellular structure, properties, and function across broad spatiotemporal scales (Cellular Dynamics and Function); and (iv) systems and/or synthetic biology to study complex interactions through modeling or manipulation or design of living systems at the molecular-to-cellular scale (Systems and Synthetic Biology). All MCB clusters prioritize projects that integrate across scales, investigate molecular and cellular evolution, synergize experimental research with computational or mathematical modeling, and/or develop innovative, broadly applicable methods and technologies. Projects that bridge the intellectual edges between MCB clusters are welcome. Projects that integrate molecular and cellular biosciences with other subdisciplines of biology are also welcome through the new Integrative Research in Biology (IntBIO) track.\n\n\nAll programs in the Directorate for Biological Sciences striveto achieve key goals laid out in the NSF Strategic Plan. Among these goals are: (i) to empower Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) talent to fully participate in science and engineering; (ii) to enable creation of new knowledge by advancing the frontiers of research and enhancing research capability; and (iii) to benefit society through translation of knowledge into solutions. In line with these goals, MCB welcomes the submission of proposals to this funding opportunity that include the participation of the full spectrum of diverse talent in STEM, e.g., as PI, co-PI, senior personnel, postdoctoral scholars, graduate or undergraduate students or trainees.  This includes historically under-represented or underserved populations, diverse institutions including Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and two-year colleges, as well as major research institutions. Proposals from EPSCoR jurisdictions are especially encouraged.MCB has a new track in this solicitation, EXPAND MCB in EPSCoR, that welcomes proposals that build capacity through collaborations led by organizations in EPSCoR jurisdictions.\n\nAlso aligned with the NSF Strategic Plan, MCB encourages submission of proposals in support of discovery-based explorations, as well as use-inspired, solutions-focused research, including proposals that address priority areas associated with building a resilient planet and biotechnology and the bioeconomy. Some examples of topics that address priority areas associated with building a resilient planet and biotechnology and the bioeconomy can be found in the life on a warming planet and bioeconomy metaprogram descriptions. The CHIPs Act of 2022 and the Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe and Secure American Bioeconomy highlight the importance of these two areas with respect to safeguarding national security and promoting prosperity. MCB also strongly encourages proposals that leverage NSF resources to facilitate integration across the biological sciences, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), data networks, synthesis centers, and institutes.\n\nRegarding health-related challenges, NSF supports basic research in all areas of the biological sciences and recognizes that this foundational research is likely to impact many different areas, including human health. MCB celebrates all the biological science discoveries funded through MCB awards that have had major impacts on health, environment, energy, food production, and other applications. Nevertheless, research focused exclusively on understanding human diseases and their treatment is normally outside of the scope offunding and will be returned without review unless that research significantly advances other fields such as engineering, computer science, or the mathematical and physical sciences.",

Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case \"omnibus\" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 \"Summary of Solicitation\", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024.   This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements.

On that page, on the right side under \"Announcement Documents\" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview.    Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.   Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES.

The research experiences will prepare clinicians to successfully compete for individual NIH mentored career development awards, or where appropriate,  independent research awards.  This FOA will also support educational activities such that participants of the R25 are expected to attend and participate in an annual workshop specific to this FOA to present their work, discuss progress and plans towards transitioning to the next career stage and to network with other researchers and leaders in their fields.  Such success will facilitate their transition from resident/fellow to physician-scientist, and will thus foster retention of a cadre of physician-scientists who will conduct research into the mechanisms of, etiology, and treatment of neurological diseases.",

Step-2 proposals cannot be submitted if a Step-1 proposal was not submitted.   Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case \"omnibus\" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 \"Summary of Solicitation\", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024.   This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements.

On that page, on the right side under \"Announcement Documents\" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview.    Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.   Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES.
